        /*
        Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of attaching individual event listeners to multiple child elements. By doing so, you can handle events that occur on the child elements through event bubbling or capturing.
        
        
        In this example, we have an unordered list (<ul>) with three list items (<li>). Instead of attaching separate event listeners to each list item, we attach a single click event listener to the parent element, the <ul> element with the id myList.
        
        When a click event occurs within the <ul> element, the event will bubble up from the target element (e.g., the clicked list item) to its parent elements. The event listener on the <ul> element captures this event and handles it.
        
        Inside the event listener function, we check if the event target's tag name is 'LI', indicating that a list item was clicked. If it is, we log the text content of the clicked list item to the console.
        
        By using event delegation, we can handle clicks on any list item within the <ul> element without having to attach a separate event listener to each list item. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with dynamic content or a large number of elements, as it improves performance and reduces memory usage.
        
        Event delegation allows us to handle events efficiently and simplifies event management by leveraging the event bubbling aznd capturing mechanisms provided by the DOM.
